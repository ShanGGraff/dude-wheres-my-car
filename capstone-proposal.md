# Capstone Proposal
## Student name: Shane Graff
------------
## Project name: Dude where's my car?
------------
## Project's purpose: 

#### To provide an app for people in the Portland metro area where they can report stolen cars and where they can report found or abandoned cars (the idea would also work for lost pets). 
------------
## Absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose.

* Form for reporting a missing car. This should include a description, model, picture, license plate number, date vehicle went missing, and the general location the vehicle was when it was stolen. Might also include if an award is being offered for the information. (This probably makes more sense if this site was about lost pets)
* Form for adding a possible stolen vehicle. This should include a description, model, picture, license plate number, date vehicle was sighted, and the general location the vehicle was when it was sighted.
* Authentication (user sign-in)
* More than barebones styling and layout (I want it to look nice)
* Will need to be able to delete and edit car entries
* I feel like I'm missing something...

## Tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, and other/resources that will be used for the project

* React/Redux
* Firebase /NoSql

## If I finish developing the MVP with time to spare, I would like to try some of the following:

* Add map using Google maps for location of car
* Looks like there may be a stolen car API on the Portland Police department website, but it appears to be broken. We need to look into further
* A real far off stretch goal would be intergrationg Paypal to pay an award for the found vehicle if one had been offered

## for the stretch goals would need to use:
* Google Maps API
* PDX Police API
* Paypal REST API
